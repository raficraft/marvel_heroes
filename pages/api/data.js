    desc: `Genius billionaire inventor, industrialist and CEO of Stark Industries Tony Stark was fatally wounded in a war zone in Afghanistan shortly before being kidnapped by terrorists. Stark built an armored suit to escape captivity, which doubled as a device to keep his heart beating keeping him alive. Once he returned to the United States, Stark reinvented himself as the armor-clad superhero Iron Man.

    In times when Tony Stark was indisposed, other men have carried on the legacy of Iron Man. Twice did Tony's best friend Jim Rhodes, and the duty has fallen into the hands of the reformed villain Victor von Doom. Most recently, the role has been usurped by Tony's adopted brother, Arno Stark.`,

After Peter's selfishness indirectly resulted in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben, Peter decided to live up to the motto that "With great power there must also come great responsibility," and thus became the superhero known as Spider-Man.`,

    desc: `Bruce Banner was a scientist who was working on a gamma bomb when he noticed teenager Rick Jones out on the test range. Although he rushed out into the test site and heroically pushed the boy into the protective trench to save him from the blast, Bruce was exposed to extreme amounts of gamma radiation that altered his DNA structure due to gamma rays and trauma passed down by his father and caused him to become a giant green (at first grey) monster of incredible power known as the Hulk whenever he starts to get angry.
    
     With his girlfriend Betty Ross seemingly being the only person able to calm the Hulk back into Banner, and often being pursued by his nemesis Thunderbolt Ross who is also Betty's Father, Bruce is often on the run while trying to find a cure for his problem and keep calm as much as he can while at the same time battling super-villains. Hulk was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1962, first appearing in Incredible Hulk #1.`,

    desc: `Leaping from the legends of Norse mythology, the Asgardian God of Thunder, Thor Odinson, is the son of Odin the All-Father and Jord, Elder Goddess and spirit of the Earth. He frequently stands alongside the Avengers in the defense of the people of Midgard (Earth), often against the schemes of his adopted brother Loki. He formerly dwelt in a recreation of Asgard in Oklahoma, using the mortal form of Donald Blake to provide a bridge between his people and the mortals surrounding them. However, Loki's subtle trickery and manipulations of Balder, combined with her time-twisting of Asgard's past and that of Bor and Odin's has enabled her to banish Thor from Asgard, stripping him of his titles, throne and legal power, and move his people to Doctor Doom's Latveria, having planned this ever since her rebirth. Thor returned to Asgard, just in time to aid them in a battle against Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers, X-Men, and H.A.M.M.E.R., killing Sentry after he destroyed Asgard. Feeling lonely, Thor has resurrected his brother Loki and father Odin and they continue to battle-on for the survival`,

    desc: `As Master of the Mystic Arts and Sorcerer Supreme, Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., is typically considered Earth's foremost expert on magic.
    But this was not always the case.
    Earlier in his life, he was a professional surgeon who had been infamous for his arrogance.
    But then he was involved a car crash that so injured his hands that it stripped him of his fine motor skills, and when that happened, he became desperate to regain them and searched the globe for a cure, squandering a fortune to that end.
    And one was offered to him--not to cure his hands, but instead to cure his soul.`,
